        <p>Lorem ipsum Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
             unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
              has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
               essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets contain
               ing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
               including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <a id ="l5text">
                I am a graduate from the University of Iowa, where I obtained my bachelors in computer science. My undergraduate coursework,
                as well as extracurricular interests, were focused on computer networking and object oriented web development.=During my undergraduate career,
                I held a position at the University of Iowa Healthcare Information Systems, where I cultivated
                my programming skills while also learning networking and picking up IT fundamentals. During my time on the
                hospitals wireless networking team, I develped a script to automate the building of a networking switch 
                configuration. While working on this project I enjoyed the idea of automation of IT tasks and discovered
                DevOps development. Now, I seek to cultivate this interest and continue learning about automation and how
                to continuously intigrate and deploy IT projects with software.
