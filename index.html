            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <a id ="l5text">
                I am a graduate from the University of Iowa, where I obtained my bachelors in computer science. My undergraduate coursework,
                as well as extracurricular interests, were focused on computer networking and object oriented web development. During my undergraduate career,
                I held a position at the University of Iowa Healthcare Information Systems, where I cultivated
                my programming skills, while also learning computer networks and picking up IT fundamentals. During my time on the
                hospitalâ€™s wireless networking team, I developed a script to automate the building of a networking switch 
                configuration. While working on this project, I enjoyed the idea of automation of IT tasks and discovered
                DevOps development. Now, I seek to cultivate this interest by continuing to learn about automation, as well as how to continuously integrate and deploy IT projects with software.
